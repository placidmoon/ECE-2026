The objective of this project is to learn to acquire signals into MATLAB and to display them for
visualization. Waveform visualization is an important tool as well as a skill in signal analysis. Signals we
learn to process in this course may be generated or recorder internally as a data array within MATLAB, or
acquired from external sources such as a wav file. Furthermore, with a proper format converter, you may also
record your own voice or music with your own computer and then load the recorded results, after converting
them to the supported formats, into MATLAB for processing to produce interesting effects.
