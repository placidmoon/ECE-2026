# Project 1: Waveform Plotting, and Reading, Recording and Writing Signals

The objective of Project 1 was to learn how to acquire signals into MATLAB and to display them for
visualization. Waveform visualization is an important tool as well as a skill in signal analysis. 

Signals we learn to process can be generated or recorded internally as a data array within MATLAB, or
acquired from external sources such as a wav file. 

Furthermore, with a proper format converter, it's possible to record voice or music with our own computers 
and then load the recorded results, after converting them to the supported formats, into MATLAB for processing to produce interesting effects. 

# How did Project 1 work? 
  1. Through the `Creating an Audio file.m`, I created a voice wave file `Q1.wav` using `audiorecorder`that features a recording of my voice saying the vowel “AAAHH.”
  2. Through the `Analyzing an Audio file.m`, I  first read `Ql.wav` through `audioread,` which converts the audio file into an array of doubles. 
  3. Then I plotted the original signal/voice into `Original Signal.jpg` and plotted 5 segments of the quasi-periodic signal into `Signal Magnified.jpg`.
