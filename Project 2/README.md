# Project 2: Using Complex Exponentials and Adding Multiple Sinusodial Waves

The goal of this project was to gain familiarity with complex numbers and their use in representing sinusoidal signals as well as finding out what would happen if numerous sinusodial waves are added. 

## How did Project 2 work?
