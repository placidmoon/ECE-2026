# Project 3: Synthesis of Sinusoidal Signals: Music and DTMF Synthesis

The objective of this project was to synthesize piano key notes and DTMF (dual tone multi frequency) signals and plot spectrograms corresponding to the signals. 

More precisely speaking, in this project, I created a "C-major scale" and a "Touch-Tone Dial Function" (based on the Extended DTMF encoding table for Touch Tone dialing) that creates a DTMF signal unique to a phone number.
