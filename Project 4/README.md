# Project 4: Synthesis of AM and FM Signals 

The objective of this project was to learn to how AM and FM signals can be synthesized. The resulting 
signal can be analyzed to show its time-frequency behavior by using the spectrogram. In this project, I created a `chirp signal` that shows behavior of frequency modulation and `arpeggio & chords` of F4, A4, C5, and F5

## How does Project 4 work?
