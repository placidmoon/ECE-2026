# Project 5: Spectrograms, Harmonic Lines, Sampling & Aliasing
### The objective of this project was:

    1. Synthesize a beat-note signal with a MATLAB M-file, and display its spectrogram. 
    2. Study the frequency resolution of the spectrogram for two closely spaced sinusoids. 
    3. Spectrogram: Make empirical observations of the spectrogram as the section length is changed. 
    4. Synthesize a linear-FM chirp with a MATLAB M-file, and display its spectrogram. 
    5. Spectrogram: Create a spectrogram that displays negative frequencies, as well as positive ones. 
    6. Synthesize a frequency-modulated (FM) signal to match a given spectrogram. i.e, match specific time specific spectral content. 
    
## Objective 1: Synthesizing a Beat note
   A beat note can be synthesized by the addition of two sinusoids.
