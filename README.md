# ECE-2026
This repository features MATLAB codes that I've written for projects created in my Intro to Digital Signal Processing class. 
Duration of this course was from '17 Jan to '17 May and principally involved manipulation of signals. 

## Brief Description of Projects 

1. Waveform Plotting, and Reading, Recording and Writing Signals ('17 1/18 - 1/24)
2. Using Complex Exponentials and Adding Multiple Sinusodial Waves ('17 1/25 - 1/31)
3. Synthesis of Sinusoidal Signals: Music and DTMF Synthesis ('17 2/1 - 2/7)
4. Synthesis of AM and FM Signals ('17 2/8 - 2/14)
